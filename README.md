# Key-HTML-CSS-Portfolio

Project Title: Keiquan Blackmon's Portfolio

Project Description: The goal of this project was to create a personal portfolio, using the the HTML and CSS skills developed over the first 2 weeks of my online coding bootcamp. The parameters of the project were as follows:

    * When a user reaches my portfolio they are greated with my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about myself, my work, and how to contact me. 
    * The links in my navbar scroll to the corresponding sections of the portfolio page
    * My application contains links to my projects completed for class (or placeholders since I've only completed one project)
    * My page is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to the audiences viewport
